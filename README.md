About the Project
This project is part of SLE-2: Profiling Report for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.

The project compares the empirical performance of two uninformed search algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Both algorithms are tested on the same binary-tree graph.

Objective
The main objective is to:

Implement BFS and DFS in Python.
Measure their execution time.
Count the number of nodes expanded.
Profile their execution using Py-Spy.
Compare the observed performance of both algorithms.
Graph Used
The experiment uses a binary-tree graph with:

Vertices (V): 65,535
Edges (E): 65,534
Start Node: 0
Goal Node: 30,000
Profiling Tools
1. timeit
Python's built-in timeit module is used to measure the execution time of BFS and DFS.

2. Py-Spy
Py-Spy is used to profile the Python program and generate flamegraphs showing where execution time is spent.

3. Node Counter
A nodes_expanded counter is maintained in both algorithms to record the number of nodes examined before reaching the goal.

Experimental Results
Metric	BFS	DFS
Average Time	4.56 ms	23.33 ms
Nodes Expanded	15,000	54,472
The reported values are from the selected experiment documented in the SLE-2 report.

Complexity
Algorithm	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case	Space Complexity
BFS	O(1)	O(V)	O(V)	O(V)
DFS	O(1)	O(V)	O(V)	O(V)
Where V represents the number of vertices.

Analysis
For this particular experiment, BFS had a lower measured execution time and expanded fewer nodes than DFS.

BFS took 5.29 ms and expanded 15,000 nodes, while DFS took 23.42 ms and expanded 54,472 nodes.

Therefore, based on the measured results, BFS showed better performance for this specific graph and goal node. The result is specific to the selected graph, implementation, and test conditions.

Flamegraphs
The profiling folder contains the flamegraphs generated during profiling:

dfs_flamegraph.svg
These provide a visual representation of the program's execution during profiling.

AI Contribution
ChatGPT was used to:

Understand BFS and DFS concepts.
Assist with the Python implementation structure.
Understand profiling using timeit and Py-Spy.
Help interpret the experimental results.
Assist in preparing the SLE-2 documentation.
The final program was executed and tested by the student, and the reported performance values were obtained from the student's execution.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the empirical performance comparison of BFS and DFS on the same binary-tree graph.

The experiment shows that execution time and the number of nodes expanded are useful measures for analysing search algorithms. Profiling helps observe the actual behaviour of an implementation under specific test conditions.
